This is my blog documenting the process of creating a chess engine and running it in a esp32.


The project has 4 seperate parts

1. The chess engine
2. Chess AI
3. ESP32 ui
4. ESP32 Networking

I will be dealing with these topic in the given order. And I'll be updating the code in this [repo](https://github.com/SamratGhale/chessmate).
