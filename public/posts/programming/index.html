<p>The more i&rsquo;ve programmed in C the more i&rsquo;ve admired it&rsquo;s simplicity.
Even when i&rsquo;m working on different programming languages I always try to think of problems in terms of how it would be implemented in C.</p>
<p>I want to give examples of features and explain why it&rsquo;s simpler than other programming languages.</p>
<h3 id="1-the-c-compilers">1. The C compilers</h3>
<p>The compiler has a very simple job; to turn C code to assembly (machine code). The compiler does many other stuffs like optimization and linking etc but turning C code to assembly is it&rsquo;s main job.
And the compiler does this task in a non complicated way</p>
<p><img src="/c_cat.PNG" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>When we look at the assembly produced by gcc for the given code this is what we get.</p>
<p><img src="/c_assembly_cat.PNG" alt=""></p>
<p>If you  just know some basic assembly we can reason about the things that the compiler produced. It loaded some constant string called &ldquo;Hello world&rdquo;, it has a section called main where it loaded the number 2 and 100 to some register, it multiplied them and called the printf function and exited.</p>
<p>As a programmer we should learn to treat compiler as a friend. Compiler isn&rsquo;t gonna fix all the bugs for you, it is gonna point out error, it&rsquo;s not magic, it&rsquo;s a tool.</p>
<h3 id="2-low-level">2. Low level</h3>
<p>If gcc is a translater from c to assembly, then C is just a high level assembly, turns out it really helps thinking that way.</p>
<p>Unlike other high level languages C dosen&rsquo;t limit you from thinking in low level as assembly. You pretty much have full controll over what goes into your executable.
Some of the few things c provides that helps you get full control of your programs are; manual memory management, control over struct layout, pointers, c calling convention.</p>
